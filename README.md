# Ensemble-Stacking-Algorithm-for-Diabetes-Prediction
An efficient Machine Learning model called Ensemble Stacking based Diabetes Classification and Prediction model that combines the results of multiple machine learning approaches in order to diagnose and predict a patient's early diabetes.
The data is gathered from UCI repository named "Pima Indian Diabetes" dataset. 
The results obtained from the testing data demonstrated that the stacked classifier model which is the combination of algorithms like K-nearest neighbours, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Random Forest has the highest accuracy at 88.5%, followed closely by the SVM at 87%. The Random Forest algorithm also shows a promising result with an accuracy of 84.5%.
